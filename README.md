# 🌲 Cypress, from Zero to the Cloud ☁️

👋 Welcome!

cy-alias
CI

Sample project to demonstrate aliasing with Cypress.

Pre-requirements
It is required to have git, Node.js and npm installed to clone and run this project.

I used versions 2.34.1, v18.15.0, and 9.5.0. of git, Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later LTS versions.

Installation
Run npm install (or npm i for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

Tests
Run npm test (or npm t for the short version) to run the tests in headless mode.

Or, run npm run cy:open to open the Cypress App and run the tests in interactive mode.
